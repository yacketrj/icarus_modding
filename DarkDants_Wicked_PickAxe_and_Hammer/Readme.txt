#The mod contains new PickAxe [Shatterspike] and Repair Tool [Oathbound Hammer]

##H2 Shatterspike
The Forsaken Pickaxe of Icarus

Forged in the heart of an ancient volcanic forge, Shatterspike is no ordinary tool—it is a weapon of legends, whispered of by miners and adventurers alike. The obsidian-black head gleams faintly in the dark, etched with runes that pulse with an eerie, green light, as though alive with an ancient and restless power. Its haft, carved from the petrified branches of the fabled Ironbark tree, is wrapped in sinewy fibers that grip your hands like a second skin.

To wield Shatterspike, one must first master the humble Stone Pickaxe—a symbol of perseverance and understanding of the earth’s secrets. Crafted with precision and care on your character, its creation requires:

10 Fiber, woven to steady the hands of its bearer.
4 Stick, imbued with resilience from the forest’s heart.
6 Stone, fragments of the earth’s unyielding spirit.

When held, Shatterspike transforms its wielder into a blur of speed, granting a 200% increase in movement speed—perfect for outmaneuvering foes or swiftly navigating treacherous terrain. Its mystical aura fortifies the bearer, increasing health regeneration by 2000, allowing them to recover from even the most grievous wounds with astonishing speed.

But Shatterspike is no mere tool for survival. When swung in battle, its strikes inflict devastating effects:

Shock, sending jolts of paralyzing energy through enemies.
Bleed, rending flesh and draining vitality.
Poison, corrupting and weakening foes over time.
This indomitable pickaxe defies the laws of decay and exhaustion: it takes no durability damage and does not drain stamina, ensuring you can mine, fight, and traverse without fear of wear or fatigue. Its enchanted blade cleaves through stone and ore with supernatural efficiency, doubling mining results and unveiling treasures that would elude lesser tools.

Legends claim Shatterspike was crafted by a forgotten race who revered the earth as both a giver of life and a crucible of destruction. Now, it lies in the hands of those bold enough to forge it—an artifact of unmatched power, waiting to carve its name into the annals of history.
